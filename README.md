# 🧮 DSA Web Application

## 📝 Project Description

The **DSA Web Application** is an interactive, browser-based platform designed to help users understand, visualize, and practice **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It provides a centralized space for learning core DSA topics through visuals, explanations, and interactive UI modules. The application aims to assist both beginners and intermediate learners in improving their problem-solving skills and grasping abstract DSA concepts with greater ease.

Built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap**, this responsive web app delivers a seamless user experience across devices and browsers. Each topic is modularized and supported with intuitive buttons and explanations, making it ideal for self-paced learning.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students and DSA learners often face the following challenges:

- Difficulty in visualizing how algorithms work.
- Lack of consolidated practice platforms.
- Boredom or confusion due to theoretical content.
- Poor retention due to static resources.

**This DSA Web Application solves these problems by:**

- Providing a visual and interactive interface for learning.
- Hosting multiple core DSA topics in one place.
- Encouraging conceptual clarity with hands-on examples.
- Delivering a clean and responsive frontend experience.
